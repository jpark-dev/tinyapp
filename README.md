- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Known Issues

- Express' res.redirect with assigned statuscode seems to have a bug when it's used twice, even if it's totally seperated within a IF Statement.


The code below did not work, console logs did not fire, and only executed one of the res.redirect() no matter what.
```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user_id) {
    return res.redirect(301, "/urls");
  }
  res.redirect(301, "/login");
});

```

Failed attempts follows:

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user_id) {
    return res.redirect(301, "/urls");
  } else {
    return res.redirect(301, "/login");
});

```

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user_id) {
    res.redirect(301, "/urls");
  } else {
    return res.redirect(301, "/login");
});

```


The working way was to assign different statuscode for each redirect, regardless of whether they are totally different case within IF statement.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user_id) {
    res.redirect(301, "/urls");
  } else {
    return res.redirect(302, "/login");
});

```

Thus, at this point, statuscode for these redirects are not assigned, and to be studied and implemented in a later stage.

```javascript
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  if (req.session.user_id) {
    return res.redirect("/urls");
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
});

```
